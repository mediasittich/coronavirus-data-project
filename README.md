Dataset: https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus

Ideas:

- Economics
- Data about different countries form UN
- Check for anomalies
- Time series/development
- Comparison of effects of different actions/policies on basis of 3 - 4 countries (e.g. US federal states)
- socio-demographics
- consider time delay in data publications
